Let’s kick off Fosdem with some interesting Kubernetes talks!

# Agenda:

Talk 1: “Running MySQL on Kubernetes: comparison of the Oracle, MariaDB, Presslabs, and Percona solutions” (Mykola Marzhan, Tech Lead at Percona, one of the authors of the Percona Operator)

Running databases in Kubernetes attracts a lot of attention today. Orсhestration of MySQL on Kubernetes is no way a straightforward process. There are several good MySQL based solutions in the open source world, made by Oracle, MariaDB, Presslabs, and Percona. Having common base, they differ in self-healing capabilities, multimaster and backup/restore support, etc. So let’s make a fair comparison to figure out the pros and cons of their current state.

Other talks TBC.
Feel free to do a proposal and send an email to hello@thomasnys.com.
