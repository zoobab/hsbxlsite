Cedric and his team perform attack simulations for governments  
and companies on a daily basis. Hacking is no rocket science,  
nor is it some kind of black magic involving computers.  

This session will contain some of Cedric's favourite attack scenario's,  
as well as a small pentesting workshop in the form of a guided CTF.  
If you want to join in on the CTF please bring your own laptop + copy of Kali Linux  
(native or running in a VM).

Disclaimer: This talk will NOT teach you how to hack your partners Facebook,  
WhatsApp or whatever social account. If you have relationship problems, try talking,  
or counselling if you must, not hacking.
