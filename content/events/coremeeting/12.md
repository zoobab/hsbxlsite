# Meeting notes
## Stuff needed at citygate

- pur plate for window next to door 4cm: 1000x1200mm
- osb plate for window next to door (1300x1100) * 2
- rockwool for insulation on top of our internal roof (to be measured)
- plexyglass for making single glass windows double glass (1350x1390) * 6
- plexyglass for making single glass windows double glass (1500x435) * 6
- silicone for plexyglass attachment


## Napkin math: pellet stove
- We started at 1500 with 15kg of pellets (€3,89 in brico).
- At 2200 we almost ran out of pellets (2 stoves on full power all the time)
- The room temprature was around 19° all the time, outside temperature around 10°
  - 7 hours of heat with 2 stoves full power for €4.

€4 / day  * 3 days / week * 30 cold weeks = **€360** / year for heating (if we insulate well and the heat from 2 heaters is enough)
Compared to **€747** we payed for gas last winter (17-18).
But we might need to invest the money we save in insulation.
