Goals
=====

* Desoldering/reading of flash chips (eMMC, TSOP, ...)
* Find JTAG pins on devices with JTAGenum

We would like to play around with desoldering and dumping memory chips.

Bring a target device and we will teach other how to remove TSOP chips, reball BGA chips and dumps NAND/NOR/eMMC memories.

We will bring an IR rework station and all the TSOP/BGA breakout boards we have around.

We will also try JTAGenum to find hidden JTAG pins on devices.

Examples
========

Requirements
============

Take devices you want to extract the flash from, like:

* smartphone
* routers
* latpop
* TVs
* other electronics

Other useful equipements:

* soldering/desoldering equipment (desoldering pump, desoldering wick)
* raspberrypi
* arduino boards
* headers and female/male wires
* breadboard
* 3.3V/5V level converters
* breakout boards

Lead
====

Our master will be Nathan Fain (cyphunk), a researcher based in Berlin and contributor to embedded tools such as JTAGenum.
