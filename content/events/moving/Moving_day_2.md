We need to get all our tools and infrastructure from the old space to the new spot 

we will move the weekend dec 15-16, packing 14the evening 

# who is available

- wouter (15 all day, 16 Before lunch)  
- Mowzes (14 evening  - 16 all afternoon-evening)  
- you ?  

# who will do what ?

- Askarel with get a van with a loading ramp for the weekend (15& 16)  
- Mowzes whatever is needed of him  on the 16th ( in direct command of Wouter)  



# general thoughts..

- get club mate and tables done first (they move easy and free up space to move the other things around) 
- member storage should also go soon (since it makes moving thru the door difficult) 
- wouter will get some pallets with walls to use for packing 
- Lets try to see if we can borrow a transpallet from someone at te new location.
