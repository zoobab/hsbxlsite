Found the very first TechTuesday which was on Apr 1st, 2009: http://hsb.wikidot.com/techtue01

# TechTuesday 500!
- TechTue v500 combined with birthday of betz!
- This is also probably the last TechTuesday at our location in Molenbeek!
- betz will bring a gas BBQ
- Stefan will get some meat/vegetables/bread for people
  - if you want him to bring something, contact him or ask the mailing list
- We are also making tons of fresh GNUwhine for this year! :)
