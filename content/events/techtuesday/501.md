Techtuesdays are a social meet-up sort of thing, just walk in for a talk, club-mate, latest news, or to show off your latest pet-project ... or you can always stay home and read slashdot.


We are currently working (tearing down a wall) in the future location of HSBXL.  
Uncertain if anyone will be in Molenbeek tonight.
