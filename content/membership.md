Being a space member has benefits but of course also some responsibilities.  
-- With great power comes great responsibility.

# Benefits
- 24/7 access
  - Every member always has access to the space. 
- Member shelf
  - Every member can get a member shelf AKA a drawer, to store personal stuff.
- Discount if/on paying activities


# Responsibilities

- There are no passengers on this ship, only crew members.
- We are explorers, no pirates.
- Upon leaving the ship, clean your spot, and the spot next to you.
- Drinks are in the fridge, they are cool, cheap and help us stay afloat.
- Respect fellow members, their privacy and hardware.
- Communication generally works better than conflict.
- The guy/girl mopping the deck deserves more respect than the non-existing captain.

Tip:

- Sharing is good, share your knowledge, creativity, hardware and code.
- Respect is not enforced, it is earned.
- Parrots have no original thoughts. Think, don't be a parrot.
- Truth is usually somewhere in the middle. Most issues aren't binary anyway. Requantize.
- Last but foremost: Be excellent to eachother.

# Steps on becoming a member

- Come over on a [TechTuesday](/events/techtuesday), come say hi.
- Fill out the membership form. 
- Find 2 sponsors to sign your membership form.
- Once processed, you will receive a welcome mail with paying instructions.
- Once we receive your payment, you can pickup an access key/badge on a next [TechTuesday](/events/techtuesday).

# Paying instructions?
Yes. As much as we would like otherwise,  
we need to pay bills to keep the ship afloat. That's why we ask **€25 a month**.  
We understand 25€ is quite a steep fee for some members, so we agreed on having a social fee of €15 a month.
If you would like to become member at a social fee,  
or you want to switch to a social fee, mail the board at [board@hsbxl.be](mailto:board@hsbxl.be?subject=social fee).  
This mail traffic is limited to people from the hackerspace board, so you can expect confidentiality.

## What are our fixed costs?
- Rent: €630/month
- Heating: +- €100/month
- Insurance: ?/year
- Legal costs (ex. statute changes): +- €100/year

Further we have nice tools and spend money at keeping it that way.
